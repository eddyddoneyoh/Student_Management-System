                                            <p align="justify">The University of Lagos Endowment Fund was first launched in 1972 on the occasion of the 10th Anniversary of the founding of the Institution. The University authorities had realised as at 
                                                that early stage, that while the Federal Government would inevitably continue to be a major source of funding of the University, there was need to establish a fund which would provide an 
                                                independent source of income. The University had of course always received assistance from organisations and individuals in the form of benefactions, endowed prizes, equipments and staff 
                                                development; the establishment of endowed fund was intended to provide a means by which cash donations could be invested to produce a regular source of income for the University.</p>

                                            <p align="justify">The formal establishment of the Alumni Relations Office in 1977 gave credence to the importance of the alumni in fostering the growth and development of the University. 
                                                In its effort to mobilize and keep its alumni together as a body, the University placed advertisements in the national dailies in 1968 calling on its graduates to submit their names and 
                                                addresses to the Student Affairs Office. The purpose was to use the medium to sensitize the alumni towards coming together to play contributory roles to their alma mater. With this 
                                                encouragement and the full support of the University, the Alumni Association was formally launched in 1970. Consequently, the establishment of the Alumni Relations Unit became inevitable.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">In 1977, the Alumni Relations Unit was created under the Registry. The unit was established basically to provide a channel of communication between the University and its alumni 
                                                all over the country and in diaspora as well as build an alumni association, for the benefit of the University as well as the National Association. The unit was also expected to encourage the 
                                                formation of branch associations, create a favourable working relationship with the Alumni Association's national office through its officers and cultivate a friendly relationship with the alumni
                                                members all over the world. The unit was further expected to give the alumni association a supporting hand particularly in prosecuting programmes that are beneficial to the University and sensitize
                                                alumni members towards identifying with their alma mater.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">The University of Lagos Endowment Fund was re-launched at the Silver Jubilee of the University in November, 1987. It became clear that while donations to the fund from organisations
                                                and individuals would continue to be most welcome, the need had arisen for the University to consciously seek aid for special projects. It was this need that motivated the University to create the Endowment
                                                Committee and an Endowment Unit in 1987 with the mandate to solicit for support from individuals and organisations by way of donations and endowment of projects in the University. The Endowment Committee also 
                                                organised a third re-launching of the fund in February 1992, while the $500 million Endowment Fund was launched in 2003.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">In 1989, the Endowment Unit was eventually merged with the Alumni Relations Unit resulting in the birth of the Alumni and Endowment Unit, under the VIce-Chancellors Office, for the purpose of
                                                using the alumni along with other philanthropists and benefactors to generate endowment funds for the University. The operation of the department was designed to bring the alumni into the new challenge of 
                                                seeking aid for special projects. The Alumni and Endowment Unit then had the mandate to solicit for support from the individuals and organizations by way of donations and endowment of projects in the University.&nbsp; 
                                                The Unit was separated again in 1998 into autonomous Endowment Unit and Alumni Relations Unit.&nbsp; However, the two Units were later merged and renamed Development Office in 2003.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">However, in line with global trends and based on the need to reposition and rebrand the University’s alumni and endowment activities, the name of the Unit was changed to the Office of Advancement in 2009.&nbsp; The
                                                Department now has the following units: Advancement Operations, Gift Administration, Alumni and Public Relations Units.&nbsp;</p>

                                            <p align="justify">Educational Advancement is devoted to the strategic and integrated management of long–term relationship with constituencies such as Alumni, Friends, Staff, Students, Government Agencies, Foundations, 
                                                Individuals and Corporate organizations for the purpose of attracting additional funding and other forms of support for the development of the institution. Endowment is the total support of a particular project 
                                                including its maintenance in perpetuity. Thus, in addition to the initial cost of the project, a lump sum is invested in an interest-yielding bank account, the proceeds of which are used for maintaining the project
                                                over time. It has been established that this arrangement is most appropriate and beneficial both for the University which would never run out of funds to maintain the project, and for the donor whose name will 
                                                continue to be associated with the project. Hence endowment is not just a modern idea, it is a sensible idea because of its enduring value.</p>

                                            <p align="justify">The result of all these University-wide efforts has been the creation of what has come to be known as general endowments, i.e. those for the general development of the University.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">General endowment as the name connotes covers all forms of donation in form of cash, educational materials, etc. for the general development of the University. No specific amount is usually attached to 
                                                this category of endowment as no amount is considered too small or too heavy in this circumstance.</p>

                                            <p align="justify">A second category of endowments exemplified by the establishment of professorial chairs based on trust funds offered by well-meaning individuals, result from fundraising programmes of sub-institutions 
                                                such as Faculties and Departments in response to specific needs and projects.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">For the establishment of a Professorial Chair, a prospective endower is expected to donate for investment an adequate amount that would yield enough interest (based on the prevailing bank rates) to service 
                                                the Chair in perpetuity. This interest that would accrue from the invested sum is estimated at <s style="text-line-through:double">N</s>15,000,000 and would take care of the Professors annual salary, salaries of his supporting staff, annual lectures/seminars,
                                                and any other incidentals.</p>

                                            <p align="justify">Following the appeal by the Office of Advancement through the Vice-Chancellor, many staff of the University have undertaken to donate to the University through the Staff (Check-Off) Endowment Fund Scheme.&nbsp; This is done by giving a 
                                                standing order to the Bursar to deduct a certain amount from the monthly salary and paid into the University of Lagos Endowment Fund for a given period of time.&nbsp; We appreciate the contributions of the staff who are already part of the Scheme even
                                                as we appeal to others to assist the University’s development efforts by joining the scheme.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that this scheme is optional.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">Apart from the Staff Check-Off Scheme, many members of staff have donated various amounts to the University.&nbsp; This 
                                                is also highly appreciated by the University.</p>

Such donations whether large or small will make tremendous difference in the life of the University.
                                                Funds raised from alumni and other donors have assisted the University in executing various projects such as hostel building, auditoria, lecture theatre etc. It has also assisted the students in the form of endowment scholarship awards in five major categories:</p>

                                                Unit was only to serve as a checker of documents emanating from the Bursary. As the University grew, the scope of responsibility of the Unit expanded with it. The Internal 
                                                Audit Unit consequently assumed its rightful role - that of being the strongest internal control outfit in the system.</p>

                                                  personnel are on the 10th Floor. It is expected that location of staff in close proximity with the university administration would enhance consultation, performance and service delivery.</p>
